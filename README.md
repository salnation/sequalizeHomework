UNIT 14 – Sequalize Homework – Reverse Engineering Code

Instructions for unit 14 homework:

-  Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.
-  In the Develop folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. 
-  Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.
-  At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.
-  Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:

As a developer:

-  I WANT:  a walk-through of the codebase.
-  SO THAT I:  can use it as a starting point for a new project.

Business Context and application:

-  When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. 
-  Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

Acceptance Criteria for homework:

-  GIVEN: a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
-  WHEN: I follow the walkthrough
-  THEN: I understand the codebase

Submission on BCS:

-  You are required to submit a link to a Google Doc explaining the application in the Develop/ folder.
